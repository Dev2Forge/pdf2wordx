    "whats_pdftoword": "<p><strong>PDFTOWORD</strong> is a program that allows you to convert <strong>PDF</strong> documents with <em>images</em> and <em>text</em> content into an editable <strong>.docx</strong> format. This program is an effective solution for those who do not want to suffer <strong><em>LOSS</em></strong> of information and do not want to <em>upload</em> our <strong>PDFs</strong> to online services, as we do not know for certain where our information travels and what happens to it. We do not know if copies are made or if they remain <em>'floating'</em> around the internet at the disposal of strangers. <br /> <strong>PDFTOWORD</strong> does all its work offline, no internet access is required, and no registration is necessary (not at all). I used the <em>library</em> <strong   ><a href='https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/pdf2docx' target='_blank'     >pdf2docx</a   ></strong > for its simplicity in <em>converting</em> a file, and its conversion is very good as the <strong>PDF</strong> design will be 99.9% of the <strong>docx</strong> design. Of course, errors can happen, such as <em>Conversion Error</em> due to the <em>image format</em> with which the <strong>PDF</strong> was created. <br> The errors <em><a href='#known_bugs'>'Known'</a></em> are listed in this section, as well as the <a href='#limits'><em>'limits'</em></a> of the conversion (if there are 'possible limits' necessary to avoid the error). Also, as stupid as it may seem, yes, there is a section on <em><a href='#how_use_title'>'How to use the program?'</a></em>. <br> The <strong>READMEs</strong> (from GitHub) of both the <strong><a href='https://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/pdf2docx' target='_blank'>pdftodocx</a></strong > repository and the program (<strong><a href='https://github.com/tutosrivegamerLQ/pdftoword' target='_blank'>PDFTOWORD</a></strong >) are at the end of this page. <br> By the way, who the hell is crazy enough to put a page in 5 languages, huh?</p>",

    "how_use_title": "<h2>How To Use PDF TO WORD?</h2>",
    "how_use": "<p>Using <strong>PDF TO WORD</strong> is very easy. First, you need to download the program (Either <em>source code</em> or <em>exe</em> - Larger size). Depending on the downloaded option (code - exe), follow these steps:<br><ul><li>If you downloaded the <em>source code</em>:</li><ol><li>You must have python installed and the <strong>pdf2docx</strong> library<br><pre>#With python installed, run CMD (Win+R, cmd) <br>pip install pdf2docx==0.5.8</pre></li><li>Once installed, unzip the downloaded <strong>zip</strong>, run the <em>script</em> <em>'main.py' (either from the terminal or direct double click)</em></li></ol><li>If you downloaded the <em>exe</em>:</li><ol><li>Run the pdftoword.exe file</li></ol><li>For both cases: </li><ol><li>Once the <em>graphical interface</em> loads, the first thing is to give a name to the file that will be saved with the <em>.docx</em> extension</li><li>Select the file by clicking on the <em>Open File</em> button</li><li>Select the directory/folder where the <em>.docx</em> file will be saved with the <em>Choose Directory</em> button</li><li>Finally, click on the <em>Convert</em> button</li></ol></ul></p>",
    "limits": "<ul><h2>Limits</h2><li>Large files <strong>(more than 20MB)</strong> may have complications, the conversion could end successfully or possibly with errors</li><li><strong>NON</strong> <em>RGB</em> formats (Image color format) will give a <em>Conversion Error</em></li><li>Only one file conversion at a time is allowed</li></ul>",
    "known_bugs_title": "<h2>Known Bugs:</h2>",
    "known_bugs": "<ul><li>Conversion error due to non-RGB image (Only RGB format images within the PDF are accepted)</li><li>The program enters <em>'The program is not responding' mode (in windows) because the interface</em> <em>freezes</em> during file conversion</em></li></ul>",
